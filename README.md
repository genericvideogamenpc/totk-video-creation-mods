# Content Creation Mods for TotK

Up above are a list of mods I personally made for use in creating content, though I don't make videos personally, I'm sure these tools will be off use to other people. Most of these mods can be used seperately, but in some cases may need to be combined. Should this occur,  multiple versions of the mod may be created. If you have any issues with the mods, please do let me know!

# Description of my mods:
Note that all of these mods were intended for use on 1.1.1, some of them may work in other versions, but I cannot guarentee they will work.
1. Greenscreen Slabs (All versions?)

Greenscreen slabs is a mod that turns DgnObj_Small_BoardStone_A_03 into a completely green object. It may changes some of the textures of a few other things. If you want help spawning the object, check out my save editor, linked above! You can edit your save and get that object and spawn it by dropping (specifically through DPAD-UP, as the inventory menu breaks when you try to select it). Recommended with No Bloom.
 
 
2. Bluescreen Slabs (All versions?)
   
Same as above, just with blue slabs instead of green. Recommended with No Bloom.


3. No Bloom (All versions?)
   
Disables that pesky bloom! This can help improve the look of light as the game is extremely heavy on its use of bloom. Great with greenscreen or bluescreen! Removes both world bloom and inventory bloom.

4. Greenscreen Background
   
Sets the color of the inventory background to green. Recommended for use with No Bloom.

5. Bluescreen Background
   
Same as greenscreen background, with blue. Use with No Bloom.
