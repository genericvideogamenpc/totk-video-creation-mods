# Content Creation Mods for TotK

Up above are a list of mods I personally made for use in creating content, though I don't make videos personally, I'm sure these tools will be off use to other people. Most of these mods can be used seperately, but in some cases may need to be combined. Should this occur,  multiple versions of the mod may be created. If you have any issues with the mods, please do let me know!

Check out my save-editor fork!

# Description of my mods:
Note that all of these mods were intended for use on 1.1.1, some of them may work in other versions, but I cannot guarentee success.
1. Greenscreen Slabs

Greenscreen slabs is a mod that turns DgnObj_Small_BoardStone_A_03 into a completely green object, though it has visual bugs. It also changes some of the textures of a few other things, since I was too lazy to make sure I was only changing the texture of the object. If you want help spawning the object, check out my save editor, linked above! You can edit your save and get that object and spawn it by dropping (specifically through DPAD-UP, as the inventory menu breaks when you try to select it.
 
 
3. Bluescreen Slabs
   
Same as above, just with blue slabs instead of green.


5. No Bloom
   
Disables that pesky bloom! This can help improve the look of light as the game is extremely heavy on its use of bloom. Great with greenscreen or bluescreen!


  
# Other people's mods:
These mods may range in a lot of versions and contains links to their repositories and download links. Please do not contact me if there are issues using these mods, I did not make them.
1. No Inventory Bloom

  https://gamebanana.com/mods/471638
  
  This is a seperate mod that removes bloom from only the inventory. The bloom mod I have created does not remove this. Incompatible with my bloom mod. In the future I may make a version of the mod which removes bloom from the inventory as well, just don't have time.

3. Ultracam

https://gamebanana.com/mods/480138

   This mod is a freecam mod, which allows the user to move the camera independently and greatly increases control of the world state for getting specific visuals. Includes framerate and configuration adjustments and more.
